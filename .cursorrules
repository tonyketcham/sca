When adding, renaming, or changing any configuration parameter or schema field, always:
- add a new schema version and pure migration functions that convert older versions to the latest in `src/utils/schemaMigrations.ts`
- update serialization in `src/utils/serialize.ts` to use the latest version and call migrations in decode/load paths
- keep migrations deterministic and side-effect free (no I/O, no randomness, no global state)

Never use `any`, avoid using `unknown`. Use complex type utilities when possible, such as mapped or conditional types.
